# Text-Visual-Separator

Text-Visual Separator

The Text-Visual Separator is a Python program designed to parse images and differentiate between textual and visual elements. Leveraging OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), this tool extracts text from images. Additionally, it utilizes basic image segmentation techniques to isolate individual visual elements within the image. The program then generates an HTML file, organizing the extracted text and visual elements into appropriate tags for easy interpretation and manipulation.

Key Features:

Image analysis to identify text and visual elements.
Text extraction using OCR capabilities.
Basic image segmentation for isolating visual elements.
HTML file generation for organizing extracted content.

Usage:

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies (opencv-python, pytesseract).
Run the image_analysis.py script, providing the path to the image you want to analyze.
Check the generated HTML file to view the extracted text and visual elements.
